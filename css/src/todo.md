Of course. Based on a review of your provided CSS property files, here is a ranked list of important missing properties and their corresponding parsers.

The list is ranked from most to least critical, focusing on what's needed to build common, modern layouts and styles.

---

### Tier 1: Critical for Layout and Core Functionality

These properties are fundamental for controlling layout, stacking order, and basic element behavior. Their absence represents a significant gap in a CSS engine.

#### 1. `z-index`

*   **Reason for Importance:** Absolutely essential for any layout using `position: absolute`, `relative`, or `fixed`. Without it, you cannot control the stacking order of overlapping elements, making complex UIs impossible.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/layout/position.rs`
    *   **Type:** `LayoutZIndex { inner: i32 }` or an enum `ZIndex { Auto, Integer(i32) }`.
    *   **Parser:** Needs to parse an integer or the keyword `auto`.

#### 2. `visibility`

*   **Reason for Importance:** A core property for showing or hiding elements. It's crucial because `visibility: hidden` is different from `display: none`â€”it hides the element but preserves its space in the layout, which is a common layout technique.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/effects.rs`
    *   **Type:** `enum StyleVisibility { Visible, Hidden, Collapse }`.
    *   **Parser:** Needs to parse the keywords `visible`, `hidden`, and `collapse`.

#### 3. `align-self` (for Flexbox)

*   **Reason for Importance:** This is the single most important missing Flexbox property. It allows an individual flex item to override the `align-items` value of its container. It is essential for creating layouts where one item needs to be aligned differently from its siblings.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/layout/flex.rs`
    *   **Type:** An enum similar to `LayoutAlignItems`, but with an added `Auto` variant: `enum LayoutAlignSelf { Auto, Stretch, Center, Start, End, Baseline }`.
    *   **Parser:** Needs to parse `auto`, `stretch`, `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, and `baseline`.

#### 4. `align-self`, `justify-self`, `align-items`, `justify-items` (for Grid)

*   **Reason for Importance:** These are the fundamental alignment properties for Grid layout, equivalent to their Flexbox counterparts. Without them, you have no control over how items are positioned *within* their grid cells.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/layout/grid.rs`
    *   **Types:** Create enums for these properties (e.g., `GridAlignItems`, `GridJustifySelf`). They will typically include values like `start`, `end`, `center`, and `stretch`.
    *   **Parser:** Parsers for each of these keyword-based enums.

#### 5. Typography Basics (`text-decoration`, `text-transform`, `font-style`, `font-weight`)

*   **Reason for Importance:** Your text styling is missing some absolute basics. Underlines, capitalization, and bold/italic styles are ubiquitous. While `font.rs` defines `StyleFontStyle` and `StyleFontWeight`, they are not exposed in `property.rs` and have no parsers wired up.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/text.rs` and `css/src/props/basic/font.rs`
    *   **Types:**
        *   `enum TextDecorationLine { None, Underline, Overline, LineThrough }`
        *   `struct TextDecoration { line: TextDecorationLine, color: ColorU, style: BorderStyle }` (to support `text-decoration-line`, `-color`, `-style`).
        *   `enum TextTransform { None, Uppercase, Lowercase, Capitalize }`.
    *   **Parser:** Wire up the existing `font-style` and `font-weight` parsers in `property.rs`. Add new parsers for `text-decoration-*` and `text-transform`.

### Tier 2: Important Shorthands and Common Properties

These are extremely common properties and shorthands that developers expect to be able to use.

#### 1. `flex` Shorthand

*   **Reason for Importance:** This is the most common way to set flexbox properties. Almost no one writes out `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis` individually.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/layout/flex.rs`
    *   **Parser:** Create a `parse_layout_flex` function. It needs to handle complex values like `flex: 1` (grow), `flex: 0 1 auto` (grow, shrink, basis), `flex: 200px` (basis), `flex: none`. The parser would then expand this into the three individual `CssProperty` variants.

#### 2. `background` Shorthand

*   **Reason for Importance:** Like `flex`, this is the primary way developers set backgrounds. Your engine already has most of the longhand properties, but is missing the shorthand parser and a few key longhands.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/background.rs`
    *   **Missing Properties:** You also need to add `background-clip`, `background-origin`, and `background-attachment`.
    *   **Parser:** A complex `parse_style_background` function that can intelligently parse a string like `#fff url(img.png) no-repeat center / cover` and map the values to the correct longhand properties.

#### 3. `gap` (and `grid-gap`) Shorthand

*   **Reason for Importance:** The `gap` property is the modern, preferred way to set spacing between grid and flex items, replacing `grid-gap`. Your engine has `row-gap` and `column-gap`, but not the shorthand.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/layout/spacing.rs`
    *   **Parser:** A `parse_layout_gap` function that accepts one or two pixel values and expands them into `LayoutRowGap` and `LayoutColumnGap`.

#### 4. `font` Shorthand

*   **Reason for Importance:** A very common way to set multiple typography properties in one line.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/basic/font.rs`
    *   **Parser:** A `parse_font` function that can parse a string like `italic bold 16px/1.5 Arial, sans-serif` and expand it into `font-style`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family`. This is a complex parser.

#### 5. List Styling Properties

*   **Reason for Importance:** You have `display: list-item`, but no way to style the list markers. These are essential for styling basic `<ul>` and `<ol>` elements.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** A new file, maybe `css/src/props/style/list.rs`.
    *   **Properties:** `list-style-type` (enum), `list-style-position` (enum), `list-style-image` (like background-image), and the `list-style` shorthand.
    *   **Parser:** Parsers for each of the new properties.

### Tier 3: Modern UI/UX and Interactivity

These properties are key to building dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.

#### 1. `transition` Properties

*   **Reason for Importance:** Transitions are the foundation of smooth animations and interactivity in modern UIs. They allow properties to change gradually instead of instantly.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** A new file, `css/src/props/style/transition.rs`.
    *   **Properties:** This is a big one. You'll need: `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function` (you have the `AnimationInterpolationFunction` enum already), `transition-delay`, and the `transition` shorthand.
    *   **Parser:** A complex shorthand parser and individual parsers for each longhand.

#### 2. `animation` Properties

*   **Reason for Importance:** For more complex, keyframe-based animations that aren't simple state transitions.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/animation.rs`.
    *   **Properties:** `animation-name`, `animation-duration`, `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`, `animation-fill-mode`, `animation-play-state`, and the `animation` shorthand. You would also need a way to parse `@keyframes` blocks.

#### 3. `pointer-events`

*   **Reason for Importance:** Crucial for UI development. Allows you to make elements non-interactive (`pointer-events: none`), which is essential for things like disabled buttons, overlays, or custom hit-testing areas.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/effects.rs`.
    *   **Type:** `enum PointerEvents { Auto, None }`.
    *   **Parser:** A simple keyword parser.

#### 4. `user-select`

*   **Reason for Importance:** Controls whether the user can select text within an element. Very important for application-like UIs where you want to prevent accidental text selection on buttons and other controls.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** `css/src/props/style/text.rs`.
    *   **Type:** `enum UserSelect { Auto, Text, None, All }`.
    *   **Parser:** A simple keyword parser.

#### 5. `object-fit` and `object-position`

*   **Reason for Importance:** The modern equivalent of `background-size` and `background-position`, but for content elements like `<img>` and `<video>`. Absolutely essential for responsive image handling.
*   **Implementation Details:**
    *   **File:** A new file, maybe `css/src/props/style/replaced.rs`.
    *   **Types:** `enum ObjectFit { Fill, Contain, Cover, None, ScaleDown }`, and reuse `StyleBackgroundPosition` for `object-position`.
    *   **Parser:** A keyword parser for `object-fit` and reuse/adapt the `background-position` parser for `object-position`.
