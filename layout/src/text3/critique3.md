Of course. Fixing the major architectural issues you've identified (Bidi, Indexing, Font Fallback, and Vertical Text) is absolutely the right priority. Once those are addressed, you will have a much more robust foundation.

However, looking deeper into the existing implementation details reveals several other specific bugs and logical flaws that would still cause problems. Here is a list of additional issues, categorized for clarity.

### Category 1: Shaping and Glyph Processing

#### Bug 1: Incorrect Glyph-to-Character Mapping for Complex Scripts
*   **Location:** `default.rs`, in the `ParsedFontTrait for ParsedFont` implementation of `shape_text`.
*   **Explanation:** The code iterates through the shaped glyphs from `allsorts` and the original text's characters in lockstep (`for info in shaped_buffer.infos` and `text_cursor.next()`). This assumes a one-to-one mapping between characters and glyphs. This assumption is fundamentally incorrect for many scripts.
    *   **Ligatures:** Two or more characters (e.g., `f` + `i`) are combined into a single glyph (`ﬁ`). The current code would advance the character iterator twice for this one glyph, completely desynchronizing the loop and leading to incorrect `codepoint` and `logical_byte_index` values for all subsequent glyphs.
    *   **Indic Scripts:** One character might be represented by multiple glyphs (e.g., a consonant and a combining vowel mark).
*   **Impact:** Text corruption, incorrect character highlighting, broken cursor positioning, and potential panics for any text that uses ligatures or complex scripts (like Arabic, Devanagari, etc.).
*   **Recommendation:** The shaping loop must be driven by "clusters," which are provided by the shaping engine (`allsorts` provides this information). A cluster groups the characters and glyphs that belong together, correctly handling many-to-one and one-to-many mappings.

#### Bug 2: Hardcoded Style Properties in Shaping
*   **Location:** `default.rs`, `shape_text` function.
*   **Explanation:** The function creates a `dummy_style` with a hardcoded `font_size_px: 16.0`. It then calculates a `scale_factor` based on this fixed size. This means the glyph advances and offsets are always calculated as if the font size were 16px, regardless of the actual style being applied.
*   **Impact:** All text will have incorrect spacing and positioning for any font size other than 16px. Text will either appear too cramped or too spread out.
*   **Recommendation:** The `shape_text` function signature must be changed to accept the `StyleProperties` (or at least the `font_size_px`) as an argument so it can calculate metrics correctly from the start.

### Category 2: Line Breaking and Justification

#### Bug 3: Hyphenation Logic is Never Correctly Used
*   **Location:** `mod.rs`, `find_line_break_with_graphemes`.
*   **Explanation:** This function is the primary line breaker. When it detects that an item overflows the line (`current_width + item_width > available_width`), it has a check for `if constraints.hyphenation`. However, inside that `if` block, it simply performs a `return Ok((i, line_items))`. It never calls the `try_hyphenate_word` function that contains the actual hyphenation logic.
*   **Impact:** Hyphenation will never occur. The line breaker will always break lines *before* a word, never *within* a word, even when `hyphenation` is enabled.
*   **Recommendation:** The line breaking logic needs to be rewritten to find the current word, call `try_hyphenate_word` on it, and if a valid break point is found, split the glyphs and insert a hyphen glyph at the break point.

#### Bug 4: Text Alignment is Incorrect for Multi-Segment Lines
*   **Location:** `mod.rs`, `UnifiedLayoutEngine::position_content` and `calculate_alignment_offset`.
*   **Explanation:** When calculating the starting offset for alignment (e.g., for `TextAlign::Center`), `calculate_alignment_offset` uses `constraints.segments.width` as the available width. This is only correct if the line consists of a single continuous segment. If text is flowing around a shape, a single line might be broken into multiple segments.
*   **Impact:** If a line of centered text flows into a segment that is not the first one on the line, it will be aligned relative to the wrong space, appearing visually incorrect and misaligned.
*   **Recommendation:** The line breaking algorithm must decide which segment a piece of the line belongs to. The alignment logic must then align the text *within that specific segment*, not relative to the start of the line.

### Category 3: Caching

#### Bug 5: Cache Key Generation is a Stub, Breaking the Cache
*   **Location:** `mod.rs`, `CacheKey::new`.
*   **Explanation:** The implementation of the cache key constructor is hardcoded to return zero-hashes: `CacheKey { content_hash: 0, constraints_hash: 0 }`.
*   **Impact:** This is a critical bug. The cache will think every single layout request is for the same content and constraints. It will compute the layout for the very first request, store it, and then **incorrectly return that same cached layout for all subsequent, different requests.** This leads to silent and catastrophic rendering errors where the screen shows completely wrong content.
*   **Recommendation:** A robust hashing function must be implemented for both `InlineContent` and `UnifiedConstraints`. This involves iterating through the content and constraints and feeding their properties into a hasher.

### Category 4: Geometry and Metrics

#### Bug 6: Shape Exclusion Logic is Imprecise
*   **Location:** `mod.rs`, `get_available_width_for_line`.
*   **Explanation:** When checking for intersections with circular or elliptical exclusions, the code checks only the vertical midpoint of the line (`line_y + constraints.line_height / 2.0`).
*   **Impact:** This is an approximation that can fail. If a shape has a thin point that only intersects with the very top or bottom of a line's area but not its center, the exclusion will be missed entirely, causing text to incorrectly render on top of the excluded shape.
*   **Recommendation:** For perfect accuracy, the intersection logic should consider the entire rectangular area of the line (from `y` to `y + line_height`). This is more computationally expensive but necessary for correctness.

Even after you fix the major architectural problems, these more subtle bugs would significantly degrade the quality and correctness of the layout engine. Addressing them will be a necessary next step toward a production-ready implementation.
