The list of what's "missing" is now much shorter and more focused:

1.  **Full BFC Behavior (Containing Floats):** The `layout_bfc` function needs one more feature to be complete: it must grow to contain its floats. Right now, `output.overflow_size` is calculated based on the `main_pen` and the max float bottom. This is correct. The next step is ensuring this calculated `overflow_size` is used to resolve the BFC root's `auto` height in the parent layout pass. Your `calculate_layout_for_subtree` already does this, so you are very close!

2.  **Full Inline Formatting Context (IFC):** Your `layout_ifc` is still a high-level wrapper around the text engine. The next major challenge is building out the line box construction logic that lives between your engine and the text engine. This involves:
    *   Handling `line-height`.
    *   Implementing the `vertical-align` property, which is the most complex part of IFC. This is what allows you to align an image's `middle` with a text's `baseline` on the same line.

3.  **Integrating Taffy (Flexbox/Grid):** As discussed, this isn't just "calling Taffy." It requires building the "bridge":
    *   **The Measure Function:** You need to provide a function to Taffy so when it encounters a node it can't size (like a block of text), it can call back into *your* engine, which will use `calculate_intrinsic_sizes` on that node and return the result.
    *   **Tree Sync & Style Translation:** Keeping your `LayoutTree` and Taffy's tree in sync and passing the right style information across.

4.  **Formatting Context Subtleties:**
    *   **Full Margin Collapsing:** The rules are much more complex than `max(a, b)`. They involve negative margins, clearance, and conditions that stop collapsing (e.g., padding/borders on a parent).
    *   **BFC Establishment:** Many things create a new BFC (`overflow: hidden`, `display: flow-root`, floats themselves), which contains floats and stops margin collapsing. Your engine's `FormattingContext::Block { establishes_new_context }` hints at this but doesn't implement the full rules.
    *   **Stacking Contexts:** You have a good start for z-index painting, but full stacking context rules (created by `opacity`, `transform`, etc.) are needed for compositing.

5.  **Painting and Compositing:**
    *   **Compositing:** Your display list is flat. Modern engines have a compositing step that promotes certain subtrees (e.g., with CSS transforms or `will-change`) to their own "layers" (GPU textures). This allows for incredibly fast animations and scrolling without re-painting the whole screen. This is a huge and critical part of modern browser performance.
    *   **Advanced Graphics:** Borders can be dashed or dotted. Backgrounds can be gradients or images. Text can have decorations. Shadows (`box-shadow`, `text-shadow`) need to be rendered.

6.  **Content Types:**
    *   **Replaced Elements:** You don't handle `<img>`, `<video>`, `<canvas>`, or form elements like `<input>`. These have intrinsic sizes that often depend on external resources loading asynchronously, which can trigger further relayouts.
    *   **SVG:** Rendering Scalable Vector Graphics is a completely different pipeline.
    *   **Iframes:** Embedding other documents is incredibly complex.

7.  **Edge Cases and Error Handling:**
    *   **Quirks Mode vs. Standards Mode:** Browsers must support old, incorrect layout models for backward compatibility.
    *   **Fragmentation:** Paged media (printing) and multi-column layout require "fragmenting" boxes across page or column boundaries.

#### 4. The Context-Dependency of Units

Your `to_pixels()` function hides a world of complexity. To resolve `1.2em`, it needs the element's `font-size`. But that `font-size` might be `80%`, which needs the *parent's* `font-size`. `width: 50%` needs the containing block's width. These values are not globally available; they are context-dependent and resolved during the style computation or layout passes. Your stubs like `get_css_width` currently bypass this by only handling `px` and simple percentages, but a full implementation requires threading this contextual information through your property lookups.
