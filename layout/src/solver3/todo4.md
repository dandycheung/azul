This is an extensive and well-architected layout engine. It demonstrates a deep understanding of the CSS specification, particularly in its non-trivial aspects like formatting contexts, stacking contexts, and incremental layout. The overall structure is sound and follows the multi-pass approach of modern browser engines.

Here is a detailed analysis based on your request, scrutinizing for correctness, bugs, limitations, and spec deviations.

### Scrutiny for Correctness & Spec Compliance

### Discovered Bugs

Despite the high quality, a few potential bugs or incorrect implementations were found:

1.  **[Bug of Omission] Incomplete Percentage Resolution:**
    *   In `solver3/positioning.rs`, the `get_css_offsets` function has a `TODO` and resolves percentages for `top`/`left`/etc. to `0.0`.
    *   **Problem:** For positioned elements, percentage offsets are relative to the containing block's size. For `top`/`bottom`, it's the CB's height; for `left`/`right`, it's the width. This is a missing feature that will lead to incorrect positioning for percentage-based values.

2.  **[Potential Bug] Writing Mode in Sizing:**
    *   In `solver3/sizing.rs`, `calculate_used_size_for_node` uses `get_css_width` and `get_css_height`. The CSS spec says that in vertical writing modes, `width` refers to the cross-axis size and `height` to the main-axis size. The implementation seems to handle this correctly by using `.with_cross()` and `.with_main()`. However, this is a very tricky area and needs careful testing with vertical modes to be confirmed as fully correct.

### Current Limitations & Missing Features

The engine is a strong foundation, but it's far from a complete browser engine. Most limitations are explicitly noted as `STUB`s.

1.  **Major Missing Layout Modes:**
    *   **Flexbox:** The single biggest missing feature for modern layouts. The `is_simple_flex_stack` is a clever optimization but not a full implementation.
    *   **Grid:** Also missing entirely.

2.  **Incomplete CSS Property Support:**
    *   **Box Model:** `box-sizing: border-box` is not implemented. `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height` are missing.
    *   **Positioning:** `position: sticky` is not implemented.
    *   **Overflow:** `overflow: clip` is treated like `visible` in some places (e.g., BFC establishment), which is incorrect.
    *   **Transforms:** No support for `transform` (e.g., `translate`, `rotate`, `scale`), which also affects stacking context creation.
    *   **Text/Font:** Most rich text properties (`line-height`, `letter-spacing`, `text-transform`, `white-space`, `vertical-align` for inline elements, etc.) are missing from the bridge to `text3`.

3.  **Reconciliation Algorithm:**
    *   As noted in the code's comments, the reconciliation is a simple list diff. It lacks **key-based reconciliation**, which is critical for performance and correctness in dynamic UIs where lists are reordered or items are inserted in the middle. Without keys, reordering `[A, B, C]` to `[C, B, A]` would be treated as three mutations instead of two moves.

4.  **Replaced Elements:**
    *   The handling of `<img>` is minimal. It doesn't account for intrinsic aspect ratios, `object-fit`, or loading the image data to determine its intrinsic size.

5.  **Tables:**
    *   Table layout is stubbed to fall back to BFC layout. A real implementation requires a complex multi-pass algorithm to resolve column and row sizes based on content.

### How Lists (`<ul>`, `<li>`) Would Be Handled

This is an excellent question that reveals a missing subsystem.

1.  **What Works Now:**
    *   By default, `<ul>` is `display: block` and `<li>` is `display: list-item`. In most browsers, `list-item` computes to have an "outside" position and an effective `display` of `block`.
    *   The current engine would treat both as `display: block`.
    *   The `layout_bfc` function would correctly stack the `<li>` elements vertically inside the `<ul>` element. The box model (padding, margin, borders) for the list and its items would be calculated correctly.

2.  **What is Critically Missing: The Marker Box**
    *   The CSS specification states that an element with `display: list-item` generates a principal **block box** and a **marker box**.
    *   The marker box contains the bullet (`â€¢`), number (`1.`), or image (`url(...)`) defined by `list-style-type`, `list-style-image`, etc.
    *   This engine has **no concept of a marker box**. It is a *generated* box that isn't represented by a DOM node.
    *   To implement lists correctly, the engine would need significant additions:
        *   **Layout Tree:** When processing a `display: list-item` node, `generate_layout_tree` would need to create a special, generated child layout node for the marker.
        *   **Layout:** The BFC/IFC logic would need to know how to position this marker. For `list-style-position: outside` (the default), the marker is placed outside the principal box's content, which can be complex. `list-style-position: inside` places it as the first inline element inside the `<li>`, which is simpler.
        *   **Display List:** New `DisplayListItem` primitives would be needed to draw the markers, or the markers would need to be converted into text runs (`DisplayListItem::Text`). This would also involve handling counters for ordered lists.

In summary, the engine can lay out the *boxes* of a list, but it cannot render the list *markers* (bullets/numbers), which is the defining visual characteristic of a list. This functionality would need to be added as a new feature.
